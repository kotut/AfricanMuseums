# AfricanMuseums
An ongoing repository list of African Museums and Cultural Heritage sites

## MuseumSourcesbyCountry
A country-by-country list of link sources enumerating museums. If the country did not contain a ministry or other official links, we defaulted to a secondary link. Wikipedia and Archive pages were used as a double-check and are included as supplemental links.

## SurveyedAfricanMuseums
To get sentiments of Museums (and cultural sites) visits, we reviewed all museums with Google reviews and sampled those with 100+ review as a means of obtaining a statistical significant sample.

The data was used to supplement a short paper submitted to AFRICHI 2018
